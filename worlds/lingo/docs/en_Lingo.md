## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

There are a couple of modes of randomization currently available. You can choose to use "door shuffle", which will turn
most of the doors in the game into items, which you will need to collect in order to open that door. There is also
"color shuffle", which creates an item for each color of puzzle (apart from White), and you will need to acquire each
color item before you are able to solve puzzles of that color.

Currently, the puzzles themselves are unchanged from vanilla.

## What is a "check" in this game?

Most panels / panel sets that open a door are now location checks, even if door shuffle is not enabled. Various other
puzzles are also location checks, including the achievement panels for each area.
