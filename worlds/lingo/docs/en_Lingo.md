# Lingo

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

There are a couple of modes of randomization currently available, and you can pick and choose which ones you would like
to use.

* **Door shuffle**: There are many doors in the game, which are opened by completing a set of panels. With door shuffle
  on, the doors become items and only open up once you receive the corresponding item. The panel sets that would
  ordinarily open the doors become locations.

* **Color shuffle**: There are ten different colours of puzzle in the game, each representing a different mechanic. With
  color
  shuffle on, you would start with only access to white puzzles. Puzzles of other colours will require you to receive an
  item in order to solve them (e.g. you can't solve any red puzzles until you receive the "Red" item).

* **Panel shuffle**: Panel shuffling replaces the puzzles on each panel with different ones. So far, the only mode of
  panel shuffling is "rearrange" mode, which simply shuffles the already-existing puzzles from the base game onto
  different panels.

* **Painting shuffle**: This randomizes the appearance of the paintings in the game, as well as which of them are warps,
  and the locations that they warp you to. It is the equivalent of an entrance randomizer in another game.

## What is a "check" in this game?

Most panels / panel sets that open a door are now location checks, even if door shuffle is not enabled. Various other
puzzles are also location checks, including the achievement panels for each area.

# What about wall snipes?

"Wall sniping" refers to the fact that you are able to solve puzzles on the other side of opaque walls. This feature is
not affected by randomization, but you are almost never required to perform a wall snipe. The exceptions to this are:

* In the Courtyard, there is a row of four puzzles that say FIRST, SECOND, THIRD, and FOURTH. FOURTH is behind an opaque
  wall, but its existence can be inferred from the others. Solving this puzzle while standing in the Courtyard is in
  logic.
    * As an aside, this snipe is different from the others in that it is possible to see the face of the panel by going
      through the nearby door (if it is open), entering the area from the roof, or entering the area through a painting
      using painting shuffle. Solving the panel in either of those ways is not in logic (particularly in the painting
      shuffle case, where you may not have access to the Courtyard itself).
* In the maze outside The Lab, there is a hidden OPEN puzzle within a wall that ordinarily opens the entrance to lab.
  Its existence can be inferred from the nearby black puzzles with the solutions "OPEN" and "BEHIND". Solving this
  puzzle while standing in the OPEN BEHIND room is in logic.
* In the hallway outside The Undeterred (blue room), there is a row of doors that reveal numbered puzzles. These puzzles
  number from one to nine. There is also a zero puzzle hidden behind a wall. Its existence can be inferred from the
  presence of the other numbers. ZERO is actually behind both a black wall and a white door. The white door opens after
  all of the NINEs have been collected (or upon receiving the appropriate item, in door shuffle mode), revealing the
  black wall. Solving the ZERO puzzle through the black wall is in logic, but solving it while the white door is still
  present is not in logic.

Any other snipe is considered out of logic. This includes sniping The Bearer's MIDDLE while standing outside The Bold,
and sniping The Colorful without opening all of the color doors.

Because these puzzles are invisible to the player, they are not affected by panel shuffling. Additionally, they are all
white puzzles, so they are not affected by color shuffling.
