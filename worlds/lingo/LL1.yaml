  # This file is an associative array where the keys are region names. Rooms
  # have three properties: entrances, panels, and doors.
  #
  # entrances is an array of regions from which this room can be accessed. The
  # key of each entry is the room that can access this one. The value is a list
  # of OR'd requirements for being able to access this room from the other one,
  # although the list can be elided if there is only one requirement, and the
  # value True can be used if there are no requirements (i.e. you always have
  # access to this room if you have access to the other). Each requirement
  # describes a door that must be opened in order to access this room from the
  # other. The door is described by both the door's name and the name of the
  # room that the door is in. The room name may be omitted if the door is
  # located in the current room.
  #
  # panels is an array of panels in the room. The key of the array is an
  # arbitrary name for the panel. Panels can have the following fields:
  # - id:            The internal ID of the panel in the LINGO map
  # - required_room: In addition to having access to this room, the player must
  #                  also have access to this other room in order to solve this
  #                  panel
  # - required_door: In addition to having access to this room, the player must
  #                  also have this door opened in order to solve this panel
  # - colors:        A list of colors that are required to be unlocked in order
  #                  to solve this panel
  # - check:         A location check will be created for this individual panel.
  #
  # doors is an array of doors associated with this room. When door
  # randomization is enabled, each of these is an item. The key is a name that
  # will be displayed as part of the item's name. The value is an array of panel
  # names from the "panels" list. These are the panels that canonically open
  # this door. If there is only one panel for the door, then that panel is a
  # check. If there is more then one panel, then that entire set of panels must
  # be solved for a check.
